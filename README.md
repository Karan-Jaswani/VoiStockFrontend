# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Available Scripts (Vite)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode using Vite. Open the URL printed in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder using Vite.

### `npm run preview`

Locally preview the production build.

Notes:
- `index.html` is now at the project root and loads `/src/index.tsx` as a module.
- Static assets in the `public` folder are served at the root (use absolute paths like `/favicon.ico`).
